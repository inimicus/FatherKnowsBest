# Father Knows Best

Spread your wisdom.

## How To Use
1. Setup keybinding under `Controls`.
2. Add wisdom via `Settings > Addons > Father Knows Best`.
3. Add a brief Wisdom Name for each piece of wisdom (will be used to identify each in a future update).
4. Create your masterpiece under Wisdom Phrase. This is what will be shared to all your new friends.

## Future Plans
Make managing and editing wisdom easier via the Addons menu. For now, you will see 
feedback about your added wisdom in the chat log. To remove or edit wisdom, logout 
and edit `SavedVariables/FatherKnowsBest.lua`. More work is needed as LibAddonMenu 
2.0 does not provide dynamic selection boxes built-in.
